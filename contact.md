<h3>Contact</h3>

<p>You may write to me at <a id="email-link" href="mailto:luisparramail@gmail.com" target="_top">luisparramail@gmail.com</a>. Or through social media, you may send me a direct message and share ideas with me.
</p>

<p>I found social media as a tool to come up with ideas and learn. I like listening to others, and sharing my  learnings helps me maintain a habit of reading.
</p>

<p>Below I show you what I do on each social network. I don’t publish the same on two networks as I think it is messy and uncomfortable to see repeated things<br/>–I wanna reach many people but offer unique content–.
</p>

<p>On Twitter and LinkedIn, I put together what I do on other networks so they work as “root” networks. In general, I tweet comments on design news and my work at college and, on LinkedIn, I post short reviews on design theories and ideas, and occasionally an article.
</p>

<h4>CodePen</h4>

<p> I write a <em>pen</em> of code each Saturday. It is a CodePen Challenge that helps me practice and gain coding skill.
</p>

<h4>Flipboard</h4>

<p>On Flipboard, I have a weekly magazine. Each one is a collection of interesting design news and articles that I commented on Twitter.
</p>

<h4>Highly</h4>

<p>I read a research paper when I don’t read news or articles. I save relevant highlights on Highly, share them on Twitter, and then publish a summary on LinkedIn. I seek to read at least one article or paper per day.
</p>

<h4>Medium</h4>

<p>Once every two weeks, I write a formal review on a design topic. I watch an idea from TED, or read an article from a blog, and think from a different point of view.
</p>

<h4>Pinterest</h4>

<p>I use Pinterest for boards of graphic design inspiration. I created one board per art movement listed by <a href="https://www.theartstory.org/section-movements.htm" target="_blank">The Art Story</a> and add a pin every day.
