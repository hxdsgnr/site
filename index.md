<h2>Hello!👋😀 I’m Luis Felipe</h2>

<p>Thank you for being here :)</p>

<p>I’m a design student, and I made this website because I’ve just found what I want for my
life.</p>

<p>I don’t just want to graduate and get a job. I want to make my life worthwhile, to be part of something great, and I knew that the best way to do this is to join a team with a shared vision. Thus here I am. I’m seeking opportunities to work with great people.
</p>

<p>On this page, I will introduce myself. I don’t have still a vast professional experience, so I think the best way is to talk to you about what moves me. This is the story of my life.
</p>

<p>I was born in Bogota, DC, in March 1999. I remember my first ideas on happiness were when I was 12. I had spent my childhood playing racing video games, and by the time I was 12, I dreamed of owning a car factory. I was very enthusiastic about that. I was reading a book on car mechanics and had decided to study Mechanical Engineering.
</p>

<p>Some years after, I realized what I liked most about cars was the way they looked on the road, the speed and the style, not the mechanics. Moreover, I was being influenced by my dad telling me about my school homework: “Do it well”. My dad has always been a perfectionist, so I was always getting good grades and, more than that, I was getting a sense of aesthetics on my homework. I wanted my homework to be beautiful, and I think this was a starter for my love for design. By the age of 15, I decided to study design. It was a special moment, my heart told me that was what I would do for my life, and the decision was not that difficult. I’m quite grateful for that.
</p>

<p>Two years later I went to university.  I knew the undergraduate program was named “Design”, not “Automotive Design”, but I pretended to focus on product design and adapt my projects to cars. It was not that easy. However, “Design” turned out to be even better than I imagined.
</p>

<p>In the first year, I had some problems with teamwork because in High School I was used to doing all by myself to get things right, and I wasn’t comfortable working on something I knew wasn’t being done in the best way. I didn’t like it so much, but then all started to go better. I felt in love with design thinking, especially because we were interacting with many people and because of those moments of “Eureka” –the insights–. We were seeing the world differently.
</p>

<p>The following semester, I was improving my ability to work in a team. We didn’t argue anymore. And next, I gained amazing confidence. I trusted what I did and was a leader. I was satisfied because our projects on design thinking were outstanding, and I like the fact that I’ve developed critical thinking also for courses on graphic and product design.
</p>

<p>Soon I stopped being interested in cars exclusively because I hadn’t liked to limit myself to one type of design, and I started looking for ideas on entrepreneurship. First, I wanted to design a hotel experience and build a whole chain, then I saw an opportunity on design for sustainability. I wanted to build a chain of restaurants that offered healthy food and had a nature theme in the interior. Then I worked on the idea of a social network that connects people deeply, not only through “stalking”. And finally, I was thinking about architecture and real estate. I worked to get investors for student residences. I imagined them as buildings with small rooms and a big and beautiful common space to work and play that would make a family from unknown people.
</p>

<p>I started design processes for these ideas, I read a lot on the internet and mapped some data and proposals. Nonetheless, latterly I realized it would be better to start working with other people as they would make my journey more effective and support me with a plethora of ideas. In addition, I thought all these ideas had an economic interest, and I don’t want that anymore. I realized I don’t want to do things for money since material things are pleasant but banal. After I get a thing I get bored and want something new. It doesn’t make sense. What I want is to make my life meaningful.
</p>

<p>And making my life meaningful has meant to find my purpose. I believe my purpose is to do my part to help build a wonderful world. I want to give my best to life, to me, to my family, to my friends, to my colleagues, through random acts of kindness and design. This is my ‘why’, what I have to live for before I die, and I feel supported, inspired by God.
</p>

<p>I want to design to improve the well-being of others and make their lives better. And I think the best way is not to start something from zero and waste time learning all by myself but to unite my knowledge with the knowledge of others and learn and build collaboratively. I want to be part of a holistic design studio. I want to team up with worker and friendly people and to create product experiences, sensible graphics, and business models that are valuable for people.
