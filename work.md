<h3>Work</h3>

<p>I’m building my portfolio through several web platforms to classify it by type of project, and because I’m still learning how to code a whole dynamic website.
</p>

<p>On Behance, I have added projects on graphic and product design. I take advantage of its infographic format to give details about the process.
</p>

<p>On Dribbble, I’m attaching some shots of my work. For instance, quick views on illustrations and digital interfaces.
</p>

<p>On Issuu, I’ve uploaded some procedure manuals that we’ve developed at Design Studio, the class on design thinking.
</p>

<p>On Wix, I made a site dedicated to design thinking projects. I wanted to put more emphasis on the process than the outcome.
</p>

<p>Most of the projects are projects developed at college, and there are others that I’ve done in my free time. For example, on Instagram, I’m working on a new idea that emerged from a piece of advice from Michael Bierut. He wrote in one of his books that doing a lot of posters is a way to do great design work, so I came out with a funny idea to do that. I’m re-designing music album covers by re-interpreting stories behind songs. I hope I have enough time to continue this project when I start the next semester at college.
