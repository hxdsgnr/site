<h3>Career</h3>

<p>My career in terms of scholar background is pretty simple. I have to admit that Iâ€™m a bit concerned that I donâ€™t study at Stanford or Harvard, but Iâ€™m so thankful because Iâ€™ve learned a lot of things and have proper bases for design.
</p>

<p>I started my design career at Universidad de Los Andes in 2016, and the last year I was granted a scholarship for an exchange at Politecnico di Milano. I will be studying from September 2019 to February 2020 courses of MSc. in Design della Comunicazione at PoliMi.
</p>

<p>My goal now is to get an internship for 2020 and then go back to Uniandes to make my thesis project. Iâ€™m very excited about the idea of an internship in California or New York. It would be the very best first step in my professional career. If you can give me a chance, please go to Contact in the menu bar ðŸ˜Š
</p>

<p>By the way, I have more information about my scholar background on my LinkedIn profile, such as my skills and courses of design that Iâ€™ve taken at college. Furthermore, you should know that, as a professional, Iâ€™ve set a concept for my personality: Iâ€™m clean, modern, vigorous, perfectionist, passionate, cool, natural, and kind. Iâ€™m a dreamer but realistic, concrete, and effective with my time. And, Iâ€™m not sure if it will be the same when talking in English, but at heart, Iâ€™m a leader.
</p>

<p>Finally, Iâ€™m working on having a strong own perspective on design. Iâ€™m thinking about a humanistic graphic design at the intersection of art and philosophy, and also about researching the influence of cultures on design. Inspiration from cultures could connect diverse people and promote a sense of difference and innovation. Further, I want to deepen in business decisions for marketing. For instance, I think a product or service would be great if it has a long-lasting impact making people feel meaningful and not only happy. A hypothesis is that this could be achieved by advertising things that promise service for society, not personal pleasure.
